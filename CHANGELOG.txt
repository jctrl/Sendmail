CHANGELOG
	
v 1.0:
- Initial non-beta release
- Added a few aliases to class methods

v 1.1:
- Added methods to read and reparse an email from a file.
	
v1.2:
- First public release
- Clarified many methods' parameters, so code hinting in some apps does not
  just show "$a, $b" but a more descriptive "$recipient_name,$recipient_email"
